## The idea behind 

Working for customer service, it was a good habit to implement a "magic" quote during a conversation.
This app collects in a searchable list some of the most famous quotes of the beloved Disney Universe.

### How to use it

Sort the quotes by typing in the search bar either Marvel, Pixar, Classic Disney or Star Wars.
